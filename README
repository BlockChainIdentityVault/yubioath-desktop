Cross-platform application for generating Open Authentication (OATH) time-based TOTP and event-based HOTP one-time password codes, with the help of a YubiKey that protects the shared secrets.

=== Features
* Keep your OATH secrets safe by storing them on a YubiKey and generate the codes with this application.
* Add a credential by scanning a QR code on the screen.
* Supports 6, 7 or 8 digit codes.
* Supports TOTP credentials with any time period.
* Require touch on YubiKey to generate code.
* Protect your credentials with a device password.

=== Supported devices
Usage of this software requires a compatible YubiKey device. Yubico
Authenticator is capable of provisioning and using both slot-based credentials
(compatible with any YubiKey that supports OTP) as well as the more powerful
standalone OATH functionality found on the NEO and YubiKey 4 series.
To use the standalone OATH functionality your YubiKey must have the CCID mode enabled,
which can be done by using the https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager-qt/[YubiKey Manager].

  - PyOtherSide
  - Qt Labs Settings
  - Qt Quick Controls
  - Qt Quick Dialogs

With these installed, you can just run the program:

    $ ./yubioath-desktop

- The icon `resources/icons/yubioath.png`, installed as `yubioath.png` somewhere
  on the
  https://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html#directory_layout[Qt]
  or
  https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/appicon.html#setting-the-application-icon-on-common-linux-desktops[Freedesktop]
  icons search path, for example as `/usr/share/pixmaps/yubioath.png`
